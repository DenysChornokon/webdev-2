                <h3>What is APC?</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>An armoured personnel carrier (APC) is a broad type of armoured military vehicle designed to
                    transport personnel and equipment in combat zones. Since World War I, APCs have become a very common
                    piece of military equipment around the world.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The genesis of the armoured personnel carrier was on the Western Front of World War I. In the later
                    stage of the war, Allied tanks could break through enemy trenches, but the infantry following—who
                    were needed to consolidate the territory acquired—still faced small arms and artillery fire. Without
                    infantry support, the tanks were isolated and more easily destroyed. In response, the British
                    experimented with carrying machine-gun crews in the Mark V* tank, but it was found that the
                    conditions inside the tanks rendered the men unfit for combat.
                    During World War II, half-tracks like the American M3 and German Sd.Kfz. 251 played a role similar
                    to post-war APCs. British Commonwealth forces relied on the full-tracked Universal Carrier. Over the
                    course of the war, APCs evolved from simple armoured cars with transport capacity to purpose-built
                    vehicles. Obsolete armoured vehicles were also repurposed as APCs, such as the various "Kangaroos"
                    converted from M7 Priest self-propelled guns and from Churchill, M3 Stuart and Ram tanks.

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>By convention, armoured personnel carriers are not intended to take part in direct-fire battle, but
                    are armed for self-defence and armoured to provide protection from shrapnel and small arms fire.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Mobility</h4>
                <p>An APC is either wheeled or tracked, or occasionally a combination of the two, as in a half-track.

                    Wheeled vehicles are typically faster on road and less expensive, however have higher ground
                    pressure which decreases mobility offroad and makes them more likely to become stuck in soft
                    terrains such as mud, snow or sand.[3]

                    Tracked vehicles typically have lower ground pressure and more maneuverability off-road. Due to the
                    limited service life of their treads, and the wear they cause on roads, tracked vehicles are
                    typically transported over long distances by rail or trucks.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Protection</h4>
                <p>Armoured personnel carriers are typically designed to protect against small arms and artillery fire.
                    Some designs have more protection; the Israeli IDF Namer has as much armour as Merkava main battle
                    tank. Armour is usually composed of steel or aluminium. They will also use bulletproof glass.

                    Many APCs are equipped with CBRN protection, which is intended to provide protection from weapons of
                    mass destruction like poison gas and radioactive/nuclear weapons.

                    Generally APCs will be lighter and less armoured than tanks or IFVs, often being open topped and
                    featuring doors and windows, as seen in the French VAB.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Weaponry</h4>
                <p>Armoured personnel carriers are designed primarily for transport and are lightly armed. They may be
                    unarmed, or armed with some combination of light, medium, heavy machine guns, or automatic grenade
                    launchers.In "open top" mounts the gunner sticks out of the vehicle and operates a gun on a pintle
                    or ring mount. A ring mount allows the gun to traverse 360 degrees, a pintle mount has a limited
                    field of fire. It can be preferable to an enclosed gunner because it allows a greater field of view
                    and communication using shouts and hand signals. However, the gunner is poorly protected and at risk
                    of injury in the event of vehicle rollover. During the Vietnam War, M113 gunners often suffered
                    heavy casualties.More recently, APCs have been equipped remote weapon systems. The baseline Stryker
                    carries an M2 on a Protector remote weapons system.</p>

            <h2>Medical use</h2>
            <p>APCs may be used as armoured ambulances, to conduct evacuations of wounded personnel. These vehicles are
                equipped with stretchers and medical supplies.

                According to article 19 of the Geneva Conventions,[5] "mobile medical units of the Medical Service may
                in no circumstances be attacked, but shall at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the
                conflict". Although article 22 allows them to carry defensive weaponry, they are typically unarmed.
                Under Article 39, the emblem of the medical service "shall be displayed ... on all equipment employed in
                the Medical Service." As such, armoured ambulances are marked with International Committee of the Red
                Cross (ICRC) recognized symbols.</p>
