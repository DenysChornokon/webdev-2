            <h2>What is aps</h2>
            <p>An armoured personnel carrier (APC) is a broad type of armoured military vehicle designed to
                transport personnel and equipment in combat zones. Since World War I, APCs have become a very common
                piece of military equipment around the world. The infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) is a derivative of the
                APC. Various classes of infantry fighting vehicles may be deployed alongside tanks and APCs, in armoured
                and mechanized forces. The fundamental difference between an APC and IFV, is the role they are designed
                to serve. The CFE treaty stipulates an infantry fighting vehicle is an APC with a cannon in excess of 20
                mm, and with this additional firepower the vehicle is more involved in combat, providing fire support to
                dismounted infantry.</p>
